## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/username/chat-app.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory `cd chat-app`

3. Compile the source code by running `gcc -o chat_app server.c`



## Usage

1. Start the chat server by running the compiled binary file.

2. Open a new terminal window and start the client by running `./chat_app`
